# MixedModels_Biases
This repository contains code that demonstrate some biases that can occur in mixed-effects ground-motion models if uncertainties in the estimated random effects are neglected via simulations.
A Markdown document describing the simulations can be read at <https://nikuehn.github.io/MixedModels_Biases/>.
